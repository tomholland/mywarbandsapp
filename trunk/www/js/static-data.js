His brow furrowed as he listened to the report from the young Shatei knelt before him, head bowed in respect. Karukichi wasn\u2019t a Lord, but to his gumi he was the undisputed leader and he made the decisions.","As the boy told of the Jung warriors\u2019 poorly concealed movements around the old Shrines in the market square of this moderately size port of Katsuyama Harukichi drummed his chubby little fingers upon the exquisitely crafted pummel of his cane. The five gold rings, adorning his fingers, each a tribute to the Fortunes, made the clinking sound members of his gumi had become familiar with when Harukichi was considering his next move. To his right the ever present Manu, his colossal form stood statuesque, only his eyes moved, scanning the buildings and alleys around them for possible danger to his Oyabun. Harukichi felt a certain amount of surprise that the pirates could make such a poor move, to so openly and brazenly challenge the Silvermoon\u2019s expansion of its base of operations was poor business. Harukichi and the leaders of the other gumi would have had no qualms allowing the Jung to continue to use the port to resupply without threat from the Prefecture, for a fair price of course. These Jung fools surely had to know that confronting the Silvermoon would end up costing them more than just the moons lining their purses.","After a good ten minutes of thought, Harukichi let out a small sigh and smiled. He was a business man, but also a gambler, and from what his men had told him he liked the odds. Soon, with the blessing of the Fortunes he would secure the location, the port and more moons for the gumi."],"type":"Scenario Objective","deployment":["Baseline Deployment","3 Scenario Objectives (Small) all Neutral"],"game_length":"Fixed (6)","objective_interaction":["Influence (Simple)"],"victory_conditions":{"points":["To the player with the most Friendly Scenario Objectives at the end of Turn 2","To the player with the most Friendly Scenario Objectives at the end of Turn 4","To the player with the most Friendly Scenario Objectives at the end of Turn 6"]},"image":"idols-seigyo-omaju.svg"}}};
